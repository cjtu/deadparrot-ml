# An Introduction to Machine Learning

This seminar series takes place in the framework of the Lowell Observatory
[Dead Parrots Python Seminar](https://github.com/LowellObservatory/DeadParrots).

Slides and example notebooks will be provided here.

# Schedule

This schedule is preliminary and might be subject to changes.

### Nov 15 - a gentle introduction
* what is machine learning, what is AI?
* tasks: unsupervised learning/supervised learning
* software: scikit-learn (and a little bit of pytorch)
* some cool application examples as motivation

### Nov 22 - unsupervised learning
* k-means clustering
* kernel density estimation 
* principal component analysis

### Nov 25 - supervised learning basics and concepts
* data: training data, test data, iid
* objective functions
* metrics and errors
* generalization and regularization
* parameters and hyperparameters

### Dec 4: more supervised learning: methods 
* k-nearest neighbors: classification and regression
* decision trees
* ensemble methods: random forests
* hyperparameter tuning

### Dec 13: deep learning and neural networks
* neurons and neural networks
* perceptrons and multi-layer perceptrons
* stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation
* convolutional neural networks
* deep learning examples
